<p>
This page is about how you can make a donation to YEF.  If you
wanted to know how you can request a donation for your Perl event from
YEF, please refer to <a href="[% organizers_page %]">organizer information</a>.
</p>
<p>
We do not currently have an automated system which can accept 
donations to YEF.  If you would like to make a donation to YEF,
please send a letter to the <a href="[% contact_page %]">general address</a>
telling us how much you would like to donate.  
</p>
<p>
Our treasurer will
respond with information on how to make a transfer to our account.
Please use 'DONATION' as the first word of the description.
</p>
<p>
Once the donation is made, our chair will send you a letter thanking
you for the donation.  This letter can be used to prove to tax authorities
that you have made a donation.
</p>
<p>
  Waiting for our own Paypal system, we have a partnership with the
  <a href="http://mongueurs.pm/" target="_new">French Perl Mongers</a>.
  You can use the button below and they will transfer the money to us.
