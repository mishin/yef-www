%]

<p>
The YAPC::Europe Foundation has an online payment system which enables it
to accept payments on behalf of your conference.
The payment system can be configured to accept payments in several currencies:
Euros (EUR), British Pounds (GBP), US Dollars (USD), Canadian Dollars (CAD),
Swiss Francs (CHF) and Japanese Yens (JPY). However, <b>Euro is the preferred
currency</b>.
In 2013, <a href="[% conf_cashflow_page %]#lpw2013">the first conference
accepting payments in Britsh Pounds</a> using the online payment system
was set up.
</p>
<p>
The Foundation will transmit the funds to the organizers' bank account
on a regular basis, paying for all the fees (online payment and transfer).
So, when an attendee pays $amount EUR, the organizers will receive $amount EUR.
Paying the bank fees is part of the sponsoring of European Perl events done
by the YAPC::Europe Foundation. It represents between 1% and 2% of the
total amount of money received through the online payment system.
See the <a href="[% conf_cashflow_page %]">conference cashflow</a> page
to see the typical time frame of payments and refunds for past conferences.
</p>
<p>
The online payment system can be plugged into the
<a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/">Act Conference Toolkit</a>, for better
integration with <a href="http://act.mongueurs.net/conferences.html">other
Perl events</a>. Integration with other systems is possible, but Act is
the only system supported at the moment.  More information about the
process of <a href="[% act_page %]">creating an Act instance for your
event</a> is also available.
</p>
You can request to use the YAPC::Europe Foundation online payment system
by writing to <a href="[% contact_page %]">the board</a>.
If the use of the online payment is granted, we require
identification and bank information; you can ensure that there is a minimal
delay by having this information ready.  The board should respond within
two weeks.  If the proposal is accepted, you will be given a contract
which describes the obligations
(an <a href="[% root %]/example_contracts/payment.pdf">example contract</a>
is available for review).  Once the contract is received by the
board chairperson, the payment system will be set up.
